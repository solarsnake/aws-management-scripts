# AWS Mangement Scripts
Basic bash scripting around the aws cli (v2) for various management tasks. Hopefully named appropriately and easy to digest.

## Requirements
Ensure that you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- [awscliv2](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)

These scripts also assume that you have valid login credentials at `~/.aws/credentials` on your system. You will be able to define which profile you use on a per-script basis.

## Notes
These are things I have found helpful for repetitive tasks in aws. They are basic hammers for basic nails. If you find any of them useful and/or timesaving, I'll be a happy camper.
